Until end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead in 60 feet that is not in total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being, but not its identity (i.e. vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that is consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You may expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it instead. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points for each one. This has no effect on undead and constructs.",

You prepare the list of  spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of  spells equal to your Cha modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum one). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Casting spells don’t remove them from your list. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.",
    "Spellcasting Ability": "Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

Oath spells don’t count against the spells you can prepare each day. If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is a paladin spell for you.",
    "Channel Divinity": "Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it. When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again. Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.",
    "Ability Score Improvement": "When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.",

    "Aura of Protection": "Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Cha modifier. You must be conscious to grant this bonus. At 18th level, the range increases to 30 feet.",
    "Aura of Courage": "Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.",
    "Improved Divine Smite": "By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them.

            "Description": "The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.",

For 1 minute, you add your Cha modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (min+1). The weapon also emits bright light for 20 feet and dim light 20 feet beyond. If the weapon isn’t already, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.",
                "Turn the Unholy": "As an action, you present your holy symbol and  speak  a  prayer  censuring  fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wis saving throw. If the  creature fails its saving  throw, it is turned  for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action."

            "Aura of Devotion": "Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.",
            "Purity of Spirit": "Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.",
            "Holy Nimbus": "At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you for 30 feet and dim light shines 30feet beyond. Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature takes 10 radiant damage. For the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against fiends/undead spells. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."
        }
    },
    "Breaking Your Oath":  "A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath. A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-­‐ night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-­‐denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh. If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another."
