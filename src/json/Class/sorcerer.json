At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-­like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dex modifier.",
            "Elemental Affinity": "Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."
