When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wis modifier + your druid level (min one). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-­level and two 2nd-­level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-­level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells. You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 min/spell level for each spell on your list.",

    "Land’s Stride": "Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement.",
    "Nature’s Ward": "When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.",
    "Nature’s Sanctuary": "When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours. The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you."
